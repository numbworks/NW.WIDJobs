We strongly recommend that candidates make their applications via the website from within the UK. Those living overseas are advised to wait until they visit the UK before launching an application.

Advice for completing the application form The application form asks for details of your: Academic record Employment and life experience International Travel, and Language and IT skills This information is vital for us to be able to evaluate your application and we would ask that you ensure that the details are as accurate as possible. This can be time consuming to provide in the format we ask for. However, these details are essential at this stage. In addition to this factual information, we ask you to answer a series of further questions. Some are competency-based which allow you to demonstrate the attributes and aptitudes that we consider essential to this role; we are less interested in a list of achievements than in understanding how you work and arrive at results. Other questions are more analytical in nature. Your answers to these questions are key to whether we think you would be suitable for this unique role. Each of these answers has a word limit. We suggest that it is easier to draft responses in MS Word (or equivalents) and then cut and paste into the application form itself. Please be aware that there is an automatic time out to this section so you may lose information if you do not save it for a long period. You should only refer to our organisation as ‘the organisation’ in any of your answers. The Recruitment Process Firstly, you will be asked to complete our pre-screening questions. If you do meet these criteria we will then ask you to begin an application. The first step will require you to create a login or log in to an existing account. Once you have successfully started an application, you will be required to complete an initial application form which contains some initial eligibility questions. If you meet our initial eligibility criteria you will be sent an e-mail asking you to take an online situational judgement test, which forms part of the formal assessment process. On receipt of this invitation e-mail, you will be asked to complete the test within the next 48 hours. If you do not complete the test within this timeframe we will assume that you no longer wish to proceed with your application. Online Verbal Reasoning Test This test is designed to assess the key skill of reasoning with verbal information, which is essential for the role of the Intelligence Officer in MI6. We encourage you to complete some practice questions for the verbal reasoning test. The practice questions are untimed, but please note that in the real test you will have 25 minutes to answer the 36 questions in the verbal reasoning test. The practice questions are not a compulsory part of the assessment and will not affect the outcome of your application. If you wish to complete the practice questions for the verbal reasoning test please click on the link below and you will be redirected: http://www.cubiksonline.com/FPD/PracticeAssessment/GenericVerbal/VerbalInstructions.aspx Situational Judgement Test During the situational judgement test you will be presented with a set of hypothetical scenarios which have been designed using situations relevant to our values and key behaviours needed to perform the Intelligence Officer role. The situational judgement test is set in the context of you taking on the role of an Intelligence Officer; however, you will not need any knowledge of the policies or procedures relating to MI6 in order to answer the questions in this test. You will just need to use your own judgement to rate the effectiveness of each option in response to the situation presented and pick the most and least effective options. This situational judgement test will present you with 22 different situations that you might have to deal with as an Intelligence Officer. It should take you approximately 45 minutes to complete the test but please be aware your session will time out automatically after 90 minutes. If you are successful at the online test stage, we will invite you to complete and submit our full application form. When you have completed all the sections of the application form, please finish the process by using the ‘Submit’ button. We have no access to your form until you do so. We ask candidates to submit within 7 days of starting their application form (or by the closing date) as this will enable us to process it as quickly as possible. If your application is successful at this stage you will be invited to attend a testing session which will take place in London and is designed to test whether you have some of the core skills and competencies essential for the role. Candidates who are successful at the testing session, will then be invited to attend an interview. The final stage of our recruitment process is a two day assessment centre. Thank you again for your interest in this role. We must remind you that confidentiality is central to our work. Please do not discuss your answers with anyone else or leave information up on screens where you may be overlooked. " ),
