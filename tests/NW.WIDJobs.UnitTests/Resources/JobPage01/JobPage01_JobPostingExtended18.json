The department’s ambition is to host an internationally leading environment for research and teaching within the broad area of strategy. The department’s research is generally cross-disciplinary. Faculty members have backgrounds in management, economics, sociology and economic geography. The theoretical foundation for research in these areas is eclectic, combining strategy, innovation, and/or internationalization theory with insights from economics, sociology, psychology, and economic geography.<br/><br/>The department puts substantial emphasis on the solid application of scientific research method. The department has a pluralistic approach to research methods that includes, for example, formal theoretical models, quantitative empirical methods such as (lab and field) experiments, econometric applications to register data or survey data, as well as qualitative research methods.<br/><br/>Core research areas of the Department include topics such as knowledge transfer, absorptive capacity, open innovation, university-industry interaction, outsourcing, internationalization, international management, patenting and licensing, high-tech entrepreneurship, firm founder characteristics, strategic human resource management, top management teams, social networks, labor mobility, innovation, team formation etc.<br/><br/>The number of staff at the department is approximately 90.
